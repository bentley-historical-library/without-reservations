      <p>The Fox Island Lighthouse Association (FILA) is a Traverse City, Michigan, non-profit organization (501(c)(3)) founded in 2004 by Sandy Bradshaw, John McKinney and Hans Joerg Rothenberger. Their goal was to rekindle the efforts of former groups for rescuing the South Fox Island light station, which had been abandoned in 1959 and has been threatened by gradual decay ever since. South Fox Island is in northern Lake Michigan, about 25 miles north of Leland, Michigan.</p>
      <p>The South Fox Island Light Station was active for 101 years, from 1867 to 1968. The first lighthouse was a square light tower attached with an attached keeper's dwelling. In the 1890s, a separate dwelling space for assistant lighthouse keepers was built as well as a fog signal building and other structures. A new, brick assistant keepers' dwelling was built in 1910. In 1934, a new light tower, a skeletal tower taken from Sapelo Island, Georgia, was installed. The light station became automated in 1958 and the last light keeper left the island. The light station was decommissioned in 1968 due to improvements in ships' onboard navigation equipment.</p>
      <p>In 1971 the U.S. Department of the Interior transferred 115 acres of land on the southern tip of South Fox Island (excepting the light station buildings and grounds) to the State of Michigan Department of Natural Resources for public use. In 1980, the light station buildings and grounds were also deeded to the State of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Until the establishment of the Fox Island Lighthouse Association, few efforts had been made toward the upkeep of the property. One exception was work done in summer 1984 by Michigan Youth Corps members under direction from the Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District Youth Employment Services. In 2002, the Fox Island Education Association (FIEA) was founded but later disbanded. Two years later, the South Fox Island Lighthouse Restoration Project (SFILRP) was founded by two former FIEA members, Sandy Bradshaw and John McKinney, along with Hans Joerg Rothenberger. SFILRP was renamed Fox Island Lighthouse Association (FILA) in 2005. It gained non-profit status in 2006 and work began on the island later that year. Since then, FILA volunteers have made significant progress in improving the condition of the light station grounds and buildings. A Historic Structure Report, completed in 2011 by U.P. Engineers &amp; Architects and submitted to the State Historical Preservation Office, now guides the restoration and construction work.</p>

      <p>The collection contains both paper and digital records, and consists of materials created or collected by the Fox Island Lighthouse Association as part of their efforts to preserve the South Fox Island light station. Collected material includes copies of U.S. Lighthouse Service and Coast Guard records from the National Archives, including photographs. The collection also includes the association's newsletters, newspaper articles about the association or the light station, a historic structures report developed for the association by U.P. Engineers &amp; Architects, and a series of oral history interviews of former lighthouse personnel, conducted by association members.</p>
      <p>The Fox Island Lighthouse Association records are organized into four series: Organizational Records, Collected Research Materials, Oral Histories, and Visual Materials. All but the Visual Materials series contain both print and digital records, and some documents exist in both formats.</p>

          <p>The Organizational Records series (4 folders and 736 MB, 1978-2012) consists of materials documenting or supporting the work of the organization, both on and off the island. This includes copies of FILA newsletters, presentation files, fact sheets about the island and its buildings, and the Historic Structure Report prepared by U.P. Engineers and Architects (which provides a history of the light station in addition to descriptions and recommendations for its buildings and structures) as well as collected news articles about the organization's work and the history of the light station.</p>

          <p>The Oral Histories series (8 folders and 496 MB, 1953 and 2009-2011) includes materials documenting oral history interviews with individuals who worked or lived at the South Fox Island Light Station while it was in operation. Interviewees include:</p>
          <p>James Alger and Paul Stephan, who both served in the U.S. Coast Guard at Clarlevoix in the mid-1950s and helped transfer people and goods from the mainland to various light stations, including the one on South Fox Island;</p>
          <p>Zane Bourisseau, who spent summers on the island as a child with his father, Frank Bourisseau, who was an assistant lightkeeper from 1928-1937;</p>
          <p>Robert [Bob] Harris, who served as an engineer at the South Fox Island light station in 1953, and his wife, Rheda ;</p>
          <p>Robert June, who served on South Fox Island in 1955 and 1956 as part of the U.S. Coast Guard, and his wife, Betty;</p>
          <p>David Markle, who served on South Fox Island as part of the U.S. Coast Guard for one season, in 1957, and his wife Audrey.</p>
          <p>The interviews serve to document the features of the island and its structures as well as stories of life on the island in the early to mid-twentieth century. The level of documentation varies by interview but may include audio files, transcripts, interview notes, summaries, diagrams, photographs, and copies of related correspondence.</p>
