      <abstract>The NSFNET 20th anniversary celebration, held November 29-30, 2007, recognized the impact and achievements of the NSFNET program. The conference featured keynote speeches and panel discussions from participants who worked directly on NSFNET, and also from those whose work it benefited. The collection contains print and digital media documenting the event: program of event proceedings, video recordings of panel discussions, video recordings of oral history project interviews, 35 mm color slides.</abstract>

      <p>NSFNET was a program established by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1985 to provide advanced networking for American research and educational institutions.[1] Advanced networks consist of interconnected computers and hardware, which facilitate the sharing of data between remote locations. This networking backbone, which transmitted data at a rate of 56 Kbit/s, provided the necessary infrastructure to connect supercomputer centers across the nation by establishing key hubs within universities that supported networking hardware. Ultimately these advances facilitated the creation of the Internet, which became a global network of interconnected networks. Through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation, Merit Network, Inc., and a consortium of Michigan universities, a collaborative effort between IBM, MCI, and the State of Michigan created the NSFNET backbone service in order to satisfy the research and education community's growing need for networked communications.[2] As a result, NSF contributed to the ongoing advancement of its backbone network by establishing T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) and T3 (45 Mbit/s) service upgrades, which greatly increased the speed of data transmissions. This increased the number of research and education institutions that hosted interconnected supercomputer centers. The University of Michigan became part of the NSFNET backbone in November 1987. Thus, by combining high-speed networking and connection between the supercomputing centers and subsequent regional networks, NSF created the "network of networks" that served as the focal point of nationwide networking and that laid the foundation for today's Internet.[3]</p>
      <p>The NSFNET 20th Anniversary collection documents the event, "NSFNET: The Partnership that Changed the World. Celebrating 20 Years of Internet Innovation and Progress," held November 29-30th, 2007, in Arlington, Virginia. The event was coordinated by a committee of individuals from organizations associated with NSFNET (including Merit, Advanced Network and Services, MCI, IBM, and the NSF) and featured keynote addresses and panel discussions related to the network's development, key partnerships, the roles played by external and international communities, and the lasting impact of NSFNET. For more information on speakers and panel discussions, refer to the event program in Box 1. (or the online version listed below).</p>

      <p>The NSFNET 20th Anniversary collection documents the event, "NSFNET: The Partnership that Changed the World. Celebrating 20 Years of Internet Innovation and Progress," held November 29-30th, 2007, in Arlington, Virginia. Consisting of website printouts, event program, archived websites, DVD-R discs, DVCAM tapes, and 35 mm color slides, the collection provides historic information regarding the foundation and progress of NSFNET over the past twenty years. The collection consists of two series: Event Information and Oral History Project.</p>

          <p>The Oral History Project series includes interviews and panel discussions video recorded during the NSFNET 20th Anniversary event as part of the Internet History Archive's Oral History Project. The John Armstrong Interview features a past NSF Director of Research reminiscing about the beginning stages of the partnership with Merit and IBM and the creation of the NSFNET networking backbone. The "Backbone of the Internet Discussion" reviews the impact of NSFNET's adoption of the T1 backbone. The "External Communities Discussion" examined the perceptions of media reporters and education professionals in regards to networking during the late 1980s. The "Government Involvement Discussion" concerns the relationship between NSFNET and ARPANET, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded networking project. The "International Perspective Discussion" reflects on NSFNET's international expansion and how such initiatives shaped data sharing between U.S. and foreign scientists. The "Mid-Level Networks Discussion" explores the creation of campus networks and the subsequent development of regional mid-level networks as university supercomputers became interconnected. The "Pre-Commercial Period Discussion" details NSFNET's transition from a university and research focus to the period when services were extended to corporations for commercial use. The "Pre-NSFNET Period Discussion" concerns pre-NSFNET activities such as CSNET, BITNET, and the development of NSF-funded national supercomputer centers between 1980-1987. Finally, the "Technological Challenges Discussion" highlights the obstacles overcome in NSFNET's development, such as a scarcity of networking equipment and the lack of a universal networking language. Project participants for each discussion are noted in the item list.</p>
