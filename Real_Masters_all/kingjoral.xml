    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Jean Ledwith King was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1924. She attended the University of Michigan for college, met her husband, John King, and in 1948 graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. In 1953, she earned a master's degree in history. She was involved in politics and, in her 40s, decided to apply to law school. She attended the University of Michigan Law School, graduated in 1968, and passed the bar exam in 1970.</p>
      <p>As an attorney, King quickly made her mark fighting sex discrimination, particularly in education. In 1970, she filed a complaint against the University of Michigan for sex discrimination, which resulted in the government withholding funds from various federal contracts until practices improved. King's efforts helped women organize to fight discrimination both formally and informally at institutions throughout Michigan and the United States.</p>
      <p>King has also been instrumental in furthering women's opportunities in athletics, beginning in the mid-1970s. One of her toughest cases was the suit against Michigan State University in 1979 for discriminating against women in the unequal treatment of the men's and women's basketball teams. Over the course of her career, King has fought for women's participation in over 30 different sports.</p>
      <p>In 2011, the Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan officially changed its name to the Jean Ledwith King Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan to honor King and further frame their own mission and identity in light of King's work and values. To celebrate this, documentary filmmaker John Owens worked to compile oral histories from King and various other individuals associated with her work for the creation of a short documentary entitled "The Power of One: Celebrating Jean Ledwith King." This film, in addition to a compilation of brief statements from politicians, female athletes, and a former law partner, was shown at the dinner held on March 26, 2011 to commemorate the Women's Center's name change (see Frank Weir, "Ann Arbor Legend Honored," <title render="italic">Grand Rapids Legal News</title>, April 2011; Mary Morgan, "Honoring Jean Ledwith King," Ann Arbor Chronicle, March 2011).</p>

          <p>The Video Recordings series (2010-2011, 62.4 GB) contains digital moving image files and is arranged by genre into three subseries: Documentary, Interviews, and Tribute Statements. The Documentary subseries contains two versions of "The Power of One: Celebrating Jean Ledwith King" created by John Owens. The Interviews subseries consists of oral history interviews conducted with King and various individuals familiar with King and her work, including some of those involved with particular cases, such as two members of the Michigan State University Women's Basketball team in the late 1970s. The Tribute Statements subseries includes statements from politicians, female athletes, and a former law partner honoring King and her impact, particularly with regard to women in politics and sports. Some of the digital file names in this series have been changed for consistency with spelling found in other sources.</p>

She gives examples of working together on cases for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] such as a Vietnam-era anti-war case.  Overall, she 'can't think about anybody who has done more for women's rights than Jean, at least in the modern age.'
